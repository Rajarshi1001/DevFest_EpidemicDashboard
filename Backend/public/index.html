        <p> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a
            newly discovered coronavirus.Most people infected with the
            COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory
            illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
            Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular
            disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more
            likely to develop serious illness.The best way to prevent and slow down
            transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus,
            the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself
            and others from infection by washing your hand using an alcohol
            based rub frequently and not touching your face.The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily
            through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an
            infected person coughs or sneezes,so itâ€™s important that you also practice
            respiratory etiquette
            (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow)</p>
        <br>
        <p>We are still learning about the risk of COVID-19 in people living with HIV.
            Current evidence suggests that people living with HIV are at higher risk of becoming seriously ill,
            and dying from, COVID-19, than people without HIV.However, HIV appears to be less of a risk factor than
            other
            health conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, severe asthma, respiratory disease, heart disease, liver
            disease,
            stroke, dementia, or older age.The best way to stay healthy is by taking your antiretroviral treatment,
            as well as any medication you have been prescribed for other health conditions.We still donâ€™t know whether
            people living with HIV are more likely to get coronavirus, the virus that causes COVID-19,
            as more research needs to be done to understand this.
            We will continue to update this page as we learn more..</p>

            Your clinic or health care provider should let you know if there are any
            changes or disruptions to services during COVID-19. If you are having trouble accessing
            the things you need, including food and medication, call your usual treatment provider.During this time,
            some governments are imposing lockdowns to stop the spread of the virus.
            This may be particularly difficult for some people. Keeping in touch with people remotely,
            such as online, by phone or by video chat, can help you to stay socially connected and mentally healthy.

            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose.
            To do so, I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
            explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure
            itself,
            because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
            consequences
            that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of
            itelf,
            because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great
            pleasure.
            take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
            advantage
            from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
            consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? [33] On the other hand, we
            denounce
            with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure
            of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue;
            and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as
            saying
            through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free
            hour,
            when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best,
            pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of
            duty
            or the obligations of business
            it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted
